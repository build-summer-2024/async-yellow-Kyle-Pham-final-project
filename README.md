[NFL Team Data 2003-2023]([https://www.example.com/link-to-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nickcantalupa/nfl-team-data-2003-2023))

## Why did I chose this dataset?

I chose the NFL stats dataset from 2003-2023 to explore how the game has changed over the years, especially in 2022 and 2023. I'm looking at key stats like total yards, pass completion, and overall team performance. My love for football started as a kid, though I didn’t start playing until high school. As a big 49ers fan, I'm also excited to see how my favorite team has done during this time. This analysis lets me dig deeper into the sport I’ve always been passionate about.
